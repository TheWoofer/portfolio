										<h2>Samuel Abling's Showoff Site</h2>
										<p>Welcome, and enjoy this slapped-together porfolio</a></p>
									</header>
									<p>
										My name is Samuel, or the "Woofer"/"Boofer" to those that know me online.
										I'm a computer gamer, an artist, a developer, a carpenter, a mechanic, a weight lifter / gym bro.. and much much more!
										I'd like to title myself 'Jack of All Trades', due to my insatiable hunger to learn new tools and develop new skills.
										But to be honest.. I'm a giant nerd.<br />
										So the title <b>'Jack of All Nerds'</b> feels more appropiate!<br />
										Currently, I'm working on multiple indie projects with friends of mine while I seek to start my career in the
										gaming industry.<br />
										Additional Info:<br />
										- 23 years old<br />
										- Current residence: North Carolina<br />
										- Open to relocation

									<h3>Technical Skills</h3>
									<p>Skills related to computer software and hardware</p>
									<dl>

										<dt>- Fundamental understanding of programming</dt>
										<dd>
											In May of '23 I began following along an online Computer Science course <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a> offers for free.<br />
											From this I learned the basics of C, Python, SQL databases, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then I've experimented with GDScript and Lua
											while developing prototypes for games I've had in mind. By far I'm no professional in development and programming, but I'm confident
											that my understanding of the foundations will allow me to further develop my skills.
										</dd><br />

										<dt>- Computer assembly and maintenance</dt>
										<dd>
											My current desktop I built from scratch in 2020 utilizing guides from online research. I do all of my own repairs and upgrades.
											It isn't the most up-to-date machine, but it's reliable for 3D modeling and playing modern games (on reduced graphical settings)!<br />
											Current Build: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 | Radeon RX 6600 | 16GB Memory
										</dd><br />

										<dt>- Game Engines</dt>
										<dd>
											I have experience utilizing the following game engines:
											<ul>
												<li>Unity</li>
												Mostly for VRChat, along with a few environment tests.
												<li>Unreal 5</li>
												I've familiarized myself with Unreal, specifically Unreal Engine for Fornite (UEFN), while attempting to create content for Fortnite.
												<li>Godot</li>
												As a result of helping a friend produce mods for small games.
												It's a small open source game engine, which I believe it's got the potential to someday be one of the greatest!
											</ul>
										</dd>

									</dl>
									<h3>Creative Skills</h3>
									<p>I specialize in creating anthropomorphic characters, but I possess a wide range of artistic skills</p>
									<dl>

										<dt>- 3D Modeling</dt>
										<dd>
											Primary software: Blender<br />
											I've been a hobbyist 3D modeler since early 2023. 
											Within it I have created hard-surface models, such as buildings, tower defense turrets, fantasy swords, 
											and even sculpted a few organic characters.<br />
											I've also dabbled in texture painting and rigged a few simple armatures with relatively simple IKs.
											Almost all of my 3D environment experience is in Blender, but I'm eager to try other software!
										</dd><br />

										<dt>- Digital Art</dt>
										<dd>
											Primary software: SAI Paint Tool 2.0 | GIMP<br />
											Truthfully, my skills as a digital artist are nothing to brag about, but I still have about 5 years of experience doodling around.
											I've sketched scenes from Dungeons and Dragons campaigns I've hosted, basic character references for 3D modeling, 
											and rough concepts for weapons, characters, effects, and locations.<br />
										</dd><br />

										<dt>- Media Editing</dt>
										<dd>
											Primary software: Davinci Resolve | Sony Pro | Audacity | GIMP<br />
											I've done basic video, audio, and image editing for personal use.<br />
											Mostly to create memes that I put in a <i>touch</i> too much effort.
										</dd>

									</dl>
									<h3>Hobbies and miscellaneous</h3>
									<p>Short list of additional activities I enjoy partaking in</p>
									<dl>

										<dt>- Gaming</dt>
										<dd>
											For as long as I can remember, I've been playing video games. Even my earliest memories involve me watching my older siblings play
											Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, and being given a controller that wasn't even plugged in whenever I begged to play!
											Didn't take long until I was playing flash games on the family computer, then free games on Steam, then modding games like Skyrim
											and Minecraft not too long after.. and then today, where I now play on a variety of systems,
											and work with close friends to create games and mods of our own!
											As for the future, I see myself working alongside professionals in the gaming industry, learning new skills from the best
											and improving my current skillsets.<br />
											<b>Top 5 favorite titles:</b>
											<ul>
												<li>Minecraft</li>
												<li>Skyrim</li>
												<li>Fallout New Vegas</li>
												<li>Baldur's Gate 3</li>
												<li>Fortnite</li>
											</ul>
										</dd><br />

										<dt>- Weight lifting</dt>
										<dd>
											I'm a firm believer that a healthy body helps maintain a healthy mind. In addition, my experience in weight training continues to
											improve my understanding of human anatomy in regards to 2D drawings and 3D character modeling.<br />
											(I love it when a muscle grouping I learned of during training gets applied to my artistic hobbies!)
										</dd><br />

										<dt>- Dungeons&Dragons, Pathfinder, and other tabletop RPGs</dt>
										<dd>
											I've played in multiple campaigns and hosted several of my own, my favorite being Dragon Heist of Waterdeep! Character design and
											creation continues to be my favorite aspect of TTRPGs.
										</dd><br />

										<dt>- Bug & Glitch hunting / QA Testing</dt>
										<dd>
											One of my favorite "side quests" to accomplish after picking up a new title, new content for a pre-existing title, or a game still in
											beta, is to hunt around for bugs and exploits to submit to the developers.<br />
											(Or to speedrun communities for titles no longer being updated.)<br />
											There's always that rush of "is that a new exploit!?" anytime I discover something new, which I follow-up with testing to
											see if I can replicate it.
											But what makes this process most enjoyable to me? I get to collaborate with the community,
											working with both the devs and individuals that share a similar interest, and feel like I'm contributing to the game.
											Someday I hope I can apply my experiences towards professional quality assurance testing in my career.<br />
											I've participated in betas and hunted bugs in many titles, including: Palworld, Skyrim, V Rising, Friends vs Friends.. and much more!
											Feel free to ask me about my tales in beta testing and bug hunting, I'd love to talk your ear off!

													Sampling of sprites I created for a mod in the game
													<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2212330/Your_Only_Move_Is_HUSTLE/"><i>Your Only Move is Hustle</i></a>.
													It's a 2D fighting game with simple characters, and a gimmick: the fights are turn-based, 
													where players input each action individually- and at the end it all plays out like a Newgrounds 2D stickman fight animation!
													This unique take combines strategy with fighting game mechanics, I highly recommend you check it out!

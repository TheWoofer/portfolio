										<h2>Welcome to my showoff site!</h2>
										<p>This website is just slapped together real quick as a portfolio</a></p>
									</header>
									<p>
										My name is Samuel, or the "Woofer"/"Boofer" to those that know me online.
										I'm a computer gamer, an artist, a game developer, a carpenter, a mechanic, a weight lifter / gym bro.. and much much more!
										I like to title myself a 'Jack of All Trades' due to my insatiable hunger to learn new tools and develop new skills.
										But to put it simply: I'm a giant nerd.<br />
										Currently, I'm working on multiple indie projects with friends of mine while I seek to start a career in the
										gaming design and development fields.<br />
										- 23 years old<br />
										- Current residence: North Carolina<br />
										- Open to relocation

									<h3>Technical Skills</h3>
									<p>Skills that are related to computer software and hardware</p>
									<dl>
										<dt>- Fundamental understanding of programming</dt>
										<dd>
											In May of '23 I began following along an online Computer Science course <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a> offers for free.<br />
											From this I learned the basics of C, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then I've experimented with GDScript and Lua
											while developing prototypes for games I've had in mind. By far I'm no professional in development and programming, but I'm confident
											enough in my abilities to further develop my skills.
										</dd><br />
										<dt>- Computer assembly and maintenance</dt>
										<dd>
											My current desktop I built from scratch in 2020 utilizing guides from online research. I do all of my own repairs and upgrades.
											It isn't the most up-to-date machine, but it's reliable for 3D modeling and playing modern games on reduced graphical settings!<br />
											Current Build: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 | Radeon RX 6600 | 16GB Memory
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<h3>Creative Skills</h3>
									<p>My artistic capabilities</p>
									<dl>
										<dt>- 3D Modeling</dt>
										<dd>
											Primary software: Blender<br />
											Within Blender I have modeled conceptual hard-surface models, such as buildings, tower defense turrets, fantasy swords, 
											and even sculpted a few organic characters.<br />
											I've also dabbled in texture painting and rigged a few simple armatures with relatively simple IKs.
											Almost all of my 3d environment experience is in Blender, but I'm eager to try other software!
										</dd><br />
										<dt>- Digital Art</dt>
										<dd>
											Primary software: SAI Paint Tool 2.0 | GIMP<br />
											Truthfully, my skills as a digital artist are nothing to brag about, but I still have about 5 years of experience doodling around.
											I've sketched scenes from Dungeons and Dragons campaigns I've hosted, basic character references for 3D modeling, 
											and rough concepts for weapons, characters, effects, and locations.<br />
										</dd><br />
										<dt>- Media Editing</dt>
										<dd>
											Primary software: Davinci Resolve | Sony Pro | Audacity | GIMP<br />
											I've done basic video, audio, and image editing for personal use.<br />
											Mostly to create memes that I put in a <i>touch</i> too much effort.
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<h3>Hobbies and miscellaneous</h3>
									<p>Short list of additional activities I enjoy partaking in</p>
									<dl>
										<dt>- Weightlifting</dt>
										<dt>- Dungeons&Dragons, Pathfinder, and other tabletop RPGs</dt>
										<dd>
											I've been apart of several campaigns and hosted several of my own, my favorite being Dragon Heist of Waterdeep!
										</dd>
										<dt>- Bug & Glitch hunting</dt>
										<dd>
											One of my favorite things to do after playing a new game or new content in a game, 
											hunting around for bugs and exploits to submit to the developers.
										</dd>

												Sampling of sprites I'm creating for a mod in the game <i>Your Only Move is Hustle</i>. It's a 2D fighting game with simple
												characters, and a gimmick: the fights are turn-based, where players input their actions individually. It's a great game that 
												combines strategy with fighting game mechanics, I highly recommend you check it out!
